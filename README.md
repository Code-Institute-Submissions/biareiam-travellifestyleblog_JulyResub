# Code Institute Data-Centric Development Milestone Project

## Whatâ€™s Up | Blog

This blog was created to host posts covering a series of different topics, such as travel, lifestyle, food & drink, fashion, and so on. Users can browse through many different posts and engage with them. If registered, users can submit, edit and delete posts published by themselves. It was designed to have clean and simple navigation, aiming for a smooth user experience. 

You can view the live site [here](https://travellifestyleblog22.herokuapp.com/)

## UI/UX

### Project goals

This project is part of my Code Institute Full Stack Software Development studies, specifically the Data-Centric Development module. The objective for this milestone project is to create a web application that allows users to store and easily access cooking recipes, using the CRUD operations of Create, Read, Update, and Delete for their recipes. The goal of this project is to create, store, edit and delete posts (CRUD). The target audience for this project is people that are interested in topics such as travel, lifestyle, books and movies. Users can create different categories, expanding the topics for discussion on the blog.

### Wireframe 

This site was built based on ideas from initial wireframes created in Figma and exported image files for these can be seen below. Some changes were done as the projects started to get into shape, for instance, the colour of the background is different from the initial idea. 

**Tablet and Mobie**

***Figma Wireframe**

<img width="552" alt="wireframe-figma" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65717229/158605393-25fe2fce-7282-45e0-a6d1-4c3465c30e69.PNG">

### Design 
This site was built using Bootstrap, as well as refactored designs I used in my previous milestones. On the homepage, the individual category page and my posts page are displayed as cards that when clicked, lead to the individual post page. 
On the individual post page, users can find the photo, name, bio and social media links to the author of the posts. by clicking on the photo or "Profile" button, the users are directed to a page where they can see the author's full profile. 
The initial idea was to create a site that would be easy to navigate without any pain points. The user can easily find what they are looking for as well as engage with the posts, by liking or leaving a comment to them. 

### Colour Scheme
Colours are kept to a minimum to keep the focus on the imagery of the post, chosen colours were based on the hero image. The Colour scheme can be found below:

### Typography
Google Fonts used across the site: 
- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mont)
- [Comfortaa](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comfortaa?preview.text=What%27s%20up%20&preview.text_type=custom)

###  Media
The images on the blog were from [Pexel](https://www.pexels.com/).

## Features

### Existing Features on every page

**Navbar**

The navigation bar features the blog name in the top left corner, which works as a link to the home page from any other page on the blog. The other navigation links are in the top right. 
For users who visited the site and are not registered/logged in yet, the following links are visible:

* Home
* Categories
* Login
* Register

<img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65717229/158068621-2d679857-dbfc-4c12-b162-a94484937852.PNG" alt="not logged in navbar">

For users who are logged in, the following links are visible:

* Home
* Categories
* Add Post
* User's name 
    * Profile (the actual profile page)
    * Edit Profile
    * My Posts
    * Settings
    * Logout 

<img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65717229/158068642-60da9b2f-4636-4209-87f7-1a752cfe7e0e.PNG" alt="logged in navbar">


Python determines if the user is logged in or not by checking if 'user' is in session and passes this data to Jinja to display the correct navbar for the user.
On the smaller resolutions (tablet, mobile) the navbar is collapsed into a burger icon. A slide-out menu opens when the burger icon is clicked.

### Elements on Multiple Pages

**Posts Cards** 

(Home, individual category page, my posts page)

-   It displays the post's image, the post category, a small headline of the post, and the date on which it was posted. The user can read the whole post by clicking on the image or the post name.

<img width="500" alt="post-card" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65717229/158068746-9fbe3bd4-796f-493a-b4af-b9296e2dbdf9.PNG">


**Pagination**

(Home, individual category page, my posts page)

- Where there are more than six results, navigation links to pages are displayed below the number of results (6 results per page).

<img width="500"  alt="pagination-homepage" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65717229/158068759-8aba7919-67bd-45a4-89a9-d6a4d30c90dd.PNG">

**Sort into categories**

(Home, categories page, individual category page, post page, my posts page)

- On the card, on the home page, it is possible to see the category the post belongs to and by clicking on it, the user is directed to a page with all the posts from that specific category. The same happens on the individual post page and also on my posts page, which is where a user can see all the posts published by himself/herself.

### Deployment

The website can be accessed [here](https://travellifestyleblog22.herokuapp.com/).

Deployment instructions assume that you have already set up your repository and basic django application. The website is deployed on the Heroku cloud platform using the following steps:

    1. Create the necessary files for deployment
    2. Create a requirements file using pip3 freeze > requirements.txt which will contain the required dependencies.
    3. Create Procfile using echo web: python app.py > Procfile.
    4. Push both files to GitHub.
    5. Log in to Heroku and create a new app
    6. Connect the app to your project
    7. Go to the deployment method section and choose the method. If using GitHub, select that option, otherwise use the Heroku CLI method.
    8. Following the GitHub method, search for the desired repository and connect to it
    9. Enter configuration variables
    10. Go to the settings tab and select Reveal Config Vars. Enter the variables defined in the env.py file (IP, PORT and SECRET_KEY).
    11. Deploy and preview
    12. Go back to the deployment tab and enable automatic deployment.
    13. Finally, press deploys branch and preview your website.
