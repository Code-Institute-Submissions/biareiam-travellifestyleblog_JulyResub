# Code Institute Data Centric Development Milestone Project

## Whatâ€™s Up | Blog

This blog was created to host posts covering a series of different topics, such as travel, lifestyle, food & drink, fashion, and so on. Users can browse through many different posts and engage with them. If registered, users can submit, edit and delete posts published by themselves. It was designed to have a clean and simple navigation, aiming for a smooth user experience. 

## UI/UX

### Project goals

This project is part of my Code Institute Full Stack Software Development studies, specifically the Data Centric Development module. The objective for this milestone project is to "Create a web application that allows users to store and easily access cooking recipes", using the CRUD operations of Create, Read, Update, and Delete for their recipes. The goal of this project is to create, store, edit and delete posts (CRUD). Target audience for this project is people that are interested in topics such as travel, lifestyle, books and movies. Users have the ability to create different categories, expanding the topics for discussion on the blog. 

### User Stories
As a user, I want: 

* Be able to view the site on my preferred device (mobile, tablet, desktop).
* Be able to view all the posts without needing to sign up.
* Be able to see each post individually.
* Be able to choose a category.
* Be able to see all the categories.
* Be able to see the profile of the author of the post.
* Be able to register to the site.
* Be able to sign in and sign out. 
* Be able to create my own profile.
* Be able to add, edit and delete posts to the website.

* Be able to add a comment to a post.
* Be able to like a post if signed in.
* Be able to read other users' comments


### Wireframe 

This site was built on the basis of ideas from initial wireframes created in Figma and exported image files for these can be seen below. Some changes were done as the projectes started to get into shape, for instance the colour of the background is different from the initial idea.

### Design 

This site was built using Bootstrap, as well as refactored designs I used in my previous milestones. On the homepage, individual category page and my posts page are displayed as cards that when clicked, lead to the individual post page. 
On the individual post page, users can find the photo, name, bio and social media links to the author of the posts. by clicking on the photo or "Profile" button, the users are directed to a page where they can see the author's full profile. 
The initial idea was to create a site which would be easy to navigate without many painpoints. The user can easily find what they are looking for as well as engage with the posts, by liking or leaving a comment to it. 

### Colour Scheme
Colours are kept to a minimum in order to keep focus on the imagery of the post, chosen colours are various shades of purple. Colour scheme can be found below:

### Typography
Two Google Fonts were used across the site: 
- [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=roboto)
- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?query=lato) 

###  Media

The images on the blog were from [Pexel](https://www.pexels.com/).


## Features

### Existing Features on every page


**Navbar**

The navigation bar features the blog name in the top left corner, which works as a link to the home page from any other page on the blog. The other navigation links are in the top right. 
For users who visited to site and are not registered/logged in yet, the follow links are visible:

* Home
* Categories
* Login
* Register

<br>
<img width="700" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65717229/157740977-d28e27a5-bd48-4949-9b23-992e14f52bca.PNG" alt="not logged in navbar">
<br>
<br>

For users who are logged in, the follow links are visible:

* Home
* Categories
* Add Post
* User's name 
    * Profile (the actual profile page)
    * Edit Profile
    * My Posts
    * Settings
    * Logout 

<br>
<img width="700" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65717229/157741278-a7392e69-6285-42be-a9e2-a07a866eadd3.PNG" alt="not logged in navbar">
<br>
<br>


Python determines if the user is logged in or not by checking if 'user' in session and passes this data to Jinja to display the correct navbar for the user.
On the smaller resolutions (tablet, mobile) the navbar is collapsed into a burger icon. A slide out menu opens when the burger icon is clicked.

<br>

**Footer**

The footer features some key Information such as copyright information and links to social media platforms.

<br>


### Elements on Multiple Pages
<br>

**Posts Cards** 
(Home, individual category page, my posts page)

It displays the post's image, a small headline of the post, date posted, author of the post and a "Read More" button which directs users to the individual post page. The user can also be directed to that page by clicking on the images. 
On large and medium devices, 3 cards are displayed in a row and on smaller devices, one card per row. If the user hover over the images, they zoom in a little, giving it a bit of effect. 

**Pagination**

(Home, individual category page, my posts page)

Where there are more than six results navigation links to pages are displayed below the number of results (6 results per page).

**Sort into categories**

(Home, categories page, individual category page, post page, my posts page)

One the card, in the home page, it is possible to see the category the post belongs to and by clicking on it, the user is directed to a page with all the posts from that specific category. The same happens on the individual post page and also on the my posts page, which is where a user can see all the posts published by himself/herself.

### Testing

### Deployment

The website can be accessed [here]().

Deployment instructions assume that you have already set up your repository and basic flask application. The website is deployed on the Heroku cloud platform using the following steps:

    1. Create the necessary files for deployment
    2. Create requirements file using pip3 freeze > requirements.txt which will contain the required dependencies.
    3. Create Procfile using echo web: python app.py > Procfile.
    4. Push both files to GitHub
    5. Login to Heroku and create a new app
    6. Connect the app to your project
    7. Go to the deployment method section and choose the method. If using GitHub, select that option, otherwise use the Heroku CLI method.
    8. Following the GitHub method, search for the desired repository and connect to it
    9. Enter configuration variables
    10. Go to the settings tab and select Reveal Config Vars. Enter the variables defined in the env.py file (IP, PORT and SECRET_KEY).
    11. Deploy and preview
    12. Go back to the deployment tab and enable automatic deployment.
    13. Finally, press deploy branch and preview your website.
